Novu provides the `@novu/react` package that helps to add a fully functioning Inbox to your web application in minutes. Let's see how easily you can use it in your application.

1. Install `@novu/react` npm package in your react app

```tsx
npm install @novu/react
```

2. Add the below code in the app.tsx file

```tsx
import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';

function Novu() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
      subscriberId="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
    />
  );
}
```

ðŸ’¡ You can find the `applicationIdentifier` in the Novu Dashboard under the [API keys page](https://dashboard.novu.co/api-keys).
The `subscriberId` is the unique identifier of the user in your application.

3. Run the app

You can now run the app and [trigger](/concepts/trigger) the events to see the Inbox in action.
