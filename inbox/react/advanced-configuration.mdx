## Use your own backend and socket URL

By default, Novu's hosted services for API and socket are used. If you want, you can override them and configure your own.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from '@novu/react';

function Novu() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
      subscriberId="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
      backendUrl="YOUR_BACKEND_URL"
      socketUrl="YOUR_SOCKET_URL"
    />
  );
}
```

## HMAC Encryption

When Novu's user adds the Inbox to their application they are required to pass a `subscriberId` which identifies the user's end-customer, and the application Identifier which is acted as a public key to communicate with the notification feed API.

A malicious actor can access the user feed by accessing the API and passing another `subscriberId` using the public application identifier.

HMAC encryption will make sure that a `subscriberId` is encrypted using the secret API key, and those will prevent malicious actors from impersonating users.

### Enabling HMAC Encryption

In order to enable Hash-Based Message Authentication Codes, you need to visit the admin panel In-App settings page and enable HMAC encryption for your environment.

</Frame>

1. Next step would be to generate an HMAC encrypted subscriberId on your backend:

```tsx
import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

const hmacHash = createHmac('sha256', process.env.NOVU_API_KEY)
  .update(subscriberId)
  .digest('hex');
```

2. Then pass the created HMAC to your client side application forward it to the component:

```tsx
<Inbox
  applicationIdentifier="YOUR_APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"
  subscriberId="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID"
  subscriberHash="YOUR_SUBSCRIBER_ID_HASH_VALUE"
/>
```

<Info>
  If HMAC encryption is active in In-App provider settings and `subscriberHash`
  along with `subscriberId` is not provided, then Inbox will not load
